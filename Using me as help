The Twice-Two Cipher 

Four veils hide the prize you seek â€”
Two of soft base, two of hard peak.
First a cradle built of sixty-four,
Then numbers march in octal war.
Again the cradle, warm and wide,
Then octal marches one last time.

Beneath these layers (neat and stacked),
A flag awaits â€” but not unpacked.
Peek from the end and work your way:
Undo the last march, then the cradleâ€™s play.
Two by two, reverse the art â€”
Turn numbers -> bytes, and base -> heart.
